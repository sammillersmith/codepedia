# What Is Object-Oriented Programming?

_Object-oriented programming (OOP)_ is a programming paradigm that allows you to package together data states and functionality to modify those data states, while keeping the details hidden away (like with the lightbulb). As a result, code with OOP design is flexible, modular, and abstract. This makes it particularly useful when you create larger programs.

## OOP Benefits

There are four major benefits to object-oriented programming:

- _Encapsulation_: In OOP, you bundle code into a single unit where you can determine the scope of each piece of data.
- _Abstraction_: By using classes, you are able to generalize your object types, simplifying your program.
- _Inheritance_: Because a class can inherit attributes and behaviors from another class, you are able to reuse more code.
- _Polymorphism_: One class can be used to create many objects, all from the same flexible piece of code.
